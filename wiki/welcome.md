# Welcome to your new DokuWiki

Congratulations, your wiki is now up and running. Here are a few more
tips to get you started.

Enjoy your work with DokuWiki,\
\-- the developers

## Create your first pages

Your wiki needs to have a start page. As long as it doesn\'t exist, this
link will be red: [start](/start).

Go on, follow that link and create the page. If you need help with using
the syntax you can always refer to the [syntax page](/wiki/syntax).

You might also want to use a sidebar. To create it, just edit the
[sidebar](/sidebar) page. Everything in that page will be shown in a
margin column on the side. Read our [FAQ on
sidebars](/doku&gt;faq/sidebar) to learn more.

Please be aware that not all templates support sidebars.

## Customize your Wiki

Once you\'re comfortable with creating and editing pages you might want
to have a look at the [configuration
settings](this&gt;doku.php?do=admin&amp;page=config) (be sure to login
as superuser first).

You may also want to see what [plugins](doku&gt;plugins) and
[templates](doku&gt;templates) are available at DokuWiki.org to extend
the functionality and looks of your DokuWiki installation.

## Join the Community

DokuWiki is an Open Source project that thrives through user
contributions. A good way to stay informed on what\'s going on and to
get useful tips in using DokuWiki is subscribing to the
[doku&gt;newsletter](doku&gt;newsletter).

The [DokuWiki User Forum](https://forum.dokuwiki.org) is an excellent
way to get in contact with other DokuWiki users and is just one of the
many ways to get [support](/doku&gt;faq/support).

Of course we\'d be more than happy to have you [getting
involved](/doku&gt;teams/getting_involved) with DokuWiki.
