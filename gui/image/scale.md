# Scale

**Resizes the image or selection.**

Resizes the image or selection horizontally and/or vertically by scale
factors (**X Scale**, **Y Scale**) entered into a dialog box (the
resulting **Width** and **Height** are calculated and displayed in the
respective boxes).

Alternatively, the desired **Width** and **Height** of the result can be
entered.

Check **Interpolate** to scale using bilinear interpolation.

**Fill with Background Color** is functonal when checked and the image
is resized in the same window.

If **Create New Window** is checked, the new image window is resized
according to the new size and the\*\* Title\*\* can be specified.

Use integer scale factors (2, 3, 5, etc.) for the best looking results,
particularly with graphics and text. With scale factors less than 1.0,
smoothing the source image prior to scaling may produce better looking
results.
