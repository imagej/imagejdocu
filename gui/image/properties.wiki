'''Displays and sets a number of properties of the current image.'''

[please update]

'''Width''' and '''Height,''' number of '''Channels,''' '''Slices''' and '''Frames''' of the image are shown. [please update about Frames]

The '''Unit of Length''' (a string describing the measuring units) by default is "inches" and can be changed to "cm". Changing this string, automatically updates the three properties below:

'''Pixel Width''', '''Height '''and''' Voxel Depth''' (in the Unit of Lenght unit).

The '''Interval''' in seconds and the coordinate reference '''Origin''' (in pixels) can also be set in this dialog.

Check the '''Global''' option to make the current settings global (i.e. in all images).
