'''Erases the contents of the selection to the current background color.'''

This command erases the contents of the current selection to the current '''background color''' (shown in the Color Picker icon). This by default it is white.

The backspace key is a handy shortcut for this command.

When the dropper tool is selected, a click on the image changes the foreground color, while Alt-click changes the background color.

Colors can be "picked up" from the '''Image>Color>Color Picker''' window using any tool. The dropper tool icon in the tool bar is drawn in the foreground color and the frame around it is drawn in the background color.

The foreground and background colors can also be set with the '''Edit>Options>Colors...''' command.
