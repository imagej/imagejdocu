====== Invert ======

**Creates a reversed image.**

Creates a reversed image, similar to a photographic negative, of the entire image or selection.

Note that the result depends on the display range of the image data, which can be set by **Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Brightness/Contrast** and read in the **Image&gt;Show Info** box. Pixels that are currently displayed as white will become black, and vice versa. Pixels having a 50% gray level will remain unchanged.
