'''Creates a reversed image.'''

Creates a reversed image, similar to a photographic negative, of the entire image or selection.

Note that the result depends on the display range of the image data, which can be set by '''Image>Adjust>Brightness/Contrast''' and read in the '''Image>Show Info''' box. Pixels that are currently displayed as white will become black, and vice versa. Pixels having a 50% gray level will remain unchanged.
