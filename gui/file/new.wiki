''Name'' is the title that will be used for the image Window. ''Type'' is the image type: 8-bit grayscale, 16-bit grayscale (unsigned), 32-bit (float) grayscale or RGB color. ''Fill With'' (White, Black, Ramp, or Clipboard Contents) specifies how the image is initialized. ''Width'' and ''Height'' specify the image dimensions in pixels. ''Width'' and ''Height'' are ignored if ''Fill With'' is set to ''Clipboard Contents''. Set ''Slices'' to a value greater than one to create a stack.
