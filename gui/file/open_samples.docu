====== Open Samples ======

**This command allows to load sample images stored at the ImageJ site.**

This submenu opens example images downloaded from the ImageJ Web site. The images can also be downloaded from http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/images/ and opened using File/Open.

This is useful to create sample macros (so they use the same image, regardless of where the macro is run).

For the DICOM (.dcm) images, press CTRL-i (Image/Show Info) to display the tags.
