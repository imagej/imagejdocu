# Page Setup\...

**The Page Setup dialog allows you to control the size of printed
output, plus other printing options.**

**Scale** values less than 100% reduce the size of printed images and
values greater than 100% increase the size. 100% corresponds to 72
pixels per inch, about the unzoomed screen size of the image.

The size of the printed image is determined by the **Scale** value and
the width and height of the image in pixels. Spatial calibration is
ignored.

Check **Draw Border** to have ImageJ print a one pixel wide black border
around the image.

Check **Center on Page** and the image will be printed in the center of
the page instead of in the upper left corner.

Check **Print Title** to have the title of the image printed at the top
of the page.

Check **Selection Only** to print the selection instead of the entire
image.

Check **Rotate 90°** and the image will be rotated 90° to the left
before being printed (ImageJ 1.33m or later).
