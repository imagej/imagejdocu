**Non-destructive marking with plugin ObjectJ**

<http://simon.bio.uva.nl/objectj>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   ObjectJ supports graphical vector objects that non-destructively
    mark images on a transparent layer.

-   Vector objects can display points or paths with sub-pixel
    resolution; they can be placed manually or by macro commands.

```{=html}

```
-   Composite objects can encapsulate different color-coded marker
    structures in order to bundle features that belong together.

```
-   ObjectJ provides back-and-forth navigation between results and
    images. The results table supports statistics, sorting, color
    coding, qualifying and macro access.

-   A single file such as \"MyProject.ojj\" is used to maintain the link
    between markers and measurements across many images or stacks.
