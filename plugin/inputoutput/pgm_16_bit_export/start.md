Export in 16 bit PGM format (ASCII)

## Introduction

This plugin was originally written to export B&W 16 bit heightmaps in a
format that can be read by CryEngine 3.

## Author

Fran√ßois.

## Features

Save image (not stack) in PGM format, 16 bit, in ASCII.

## Description

that\'s so, a dialog is opened, to save the file in PGM (ASCII). The
plugin is designed only for images, not for stacks.
