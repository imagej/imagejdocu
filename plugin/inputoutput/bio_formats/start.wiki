== Description ==

Bio-Formats is a standalone Java library for reading and writing popular microscopy file formats. It is capable of parsing both pixels and metadata for a large number of formats, as well as writing to several formats. It also includes processing and conversion of metadata into standard OME-XML structures.

It is available as a collection of ImageJ plugins, to read and write images in the formats it supports.

See the [[http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/formats.html|Bio-Formats web site]] for a complete list of supported file formats, installation instructions, source code, and other details.
