= Euclidean minimum spanning tree =
This plugin calculates and draws an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree|euclidean minimum spanning tree]] from a set of selection points. Coordinates of the EMST are available in "Results" table. The algorithm is based on:

1) 2D Delaunay Triangulation (DT) with incremental site insertion written by [[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/chew/Delaunay.html|Paul Chew]]<br />
2) [[http://jgrapht.org/|JgraphT 0.9.0]] under LPGL and EPL<br />
3) [[http://fiji.sc/Delaunay_Voronoi|Delaunay/Voronopi plugin]] written by Johannes Schindelin: the current plugin was inspired by Johannes' plugin but with some changes. The EMST is a sub-tree of Delaunay triangulation. Therefore the original points selection are used to create Delaunay triangulation. Corresponding edges are injected in the JGraphT code and MST is requested.

{{:plugin:morphology:euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree:input1.jpg|}}
{{:plugin:morphology:euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree:input2.jpg|}}

From a picture containing selection points, you are requested to choose:<br />
1) The color of the edges<br />
2) Approximate number of points (requested to optimized internal HashMap Java algorithm)<br />
3) If you want corresponding edges coordinates<br />
4) If you want a skeletonized EMST ([[http://www.snv.jussieu.fr/~wboudier/softs.html|Thomas Boudier's]] suggestion). It is possible to call the plugin from a macro as follows:<br /> run("EMST", "color=Yellow approximate=500 export create");

{{:plugin:morphology:euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree:output2.jpg|}}
{{:plugin:morphology:euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree:output3.jpg|}}

Two different outputs can be obtained from the same EMST: 1) one is an overlay added to the original picture which contains the selection points. 2) The second one is a binary picture representing one '''skeleton''' without loop which can be analyzed immediately with the plugin [[http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/AnalyzeSkeleton|Analyze Skeleton]]


= Installation =
Simply download {{:plugin:morphology:euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree:e_mst2.jar|}} to the Plugins folder of ImageJ, restart ImageJ and use the “EMST” command in the Plugins menu.
