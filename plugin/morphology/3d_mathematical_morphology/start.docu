===== Description =====

3D mathematical **operations** (erosion, dilatation, ...) are available in [[plugin:filter:3d_filters:start|3D filters]] using minimum and maximum filters. 

A 3D **Fill Holes** is available, works the same way as in 2D but will not fill holes if it is not closed in the Z dimension. 

A 3D **Euclidean Distance Map** is available that takes into account the calibration of the image stack. A 3D normalized dsitance map (called Eroded Volume Fraction, or **EVF**) is also available.

In the case of labelled objects (as count masks) a **Binary Close Labels** is available, that permits to performs closing on individual objects, hence avoiding objects to touch during dilatation operation.
