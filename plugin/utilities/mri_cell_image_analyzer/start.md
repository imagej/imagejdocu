# MRI Cell Image Analyzer

**A visual scripting interface for ImageJ and its usage at the
microscopy platform Montpellier RIO Imaging**

A rapid image analysis application development framework called \"Cell
Image Analyzer\" based on ImageJ is presented. It adds a visual
scripting interface to ImageJ\'s capabilities, which allows creating
applications from existing operations by drag and drop. It provides
support to create batch applications as well as interactive
applications. \"Cell Image Analyzer\" is used at the microscopy facility
Montpellier RIO Imaging to create custom image analysis applications and
to solve automation tasks. The applications include the topics \"DNA
combing\", \"quantification of stained proteins in cells\", \"comparison
of intensity ratios between nuclei and cytoplasm\" and \"counting nuclei
stained in different channels\".
