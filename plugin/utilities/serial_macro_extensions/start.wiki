= Serial Macro Extensions =

== Introduction ==

This plugin provides methods to talk to a device attached to a serial port, directly from the ImageJ Macro language, using the Macro Extension mechanism. You can easily:

* list the available serial ports
* establish a serial connection
* check if the serial connection is alive
* send commands over the serial connection
* recieve what is available from the serial port
* close the connection

It works with any serial device, but was developped to talk with the Arduino board, an open-source electronics prototyping platform (http://arduino.cc/). 

== See also ==

* IJSerial plugin (http://www.eslide.net/) can also be used, but it requires a separate config file, and does not provide persistence to the serial connection.

== Installation ==
=== Windows ===
* Requires RXTX library 
* 2018-10-8 (MIFOBIO2018): a working RXTX version for Windows 64-bit systems was obtained from http://fizzed.com/oss/rxtx-for-java. Copy RXTXcomm.jar to jre/lib/ext/ and rxtxSerial.dll and rxtxParallel.dll to jre/bin 
* Download serial_ext.jar to the plugins folder
* Restart ImageJ
=== Other platforms ===
* Install RXTX according to http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Installation
* Download serial_ext.jar to the plugins folder
* Restart ImageJ

== Usage ==

* Make the macro interpreter aware of the new extensions:
<source>
run("serial ext");
</source>
* Get a list of available serial ports:
<source>
ports = Ext.ports();
</source>
* Establish a serial connection to the serial device, using COM8 port and a bitrate of 9600 bps:
<source>
Ext.open("COM8",9600,""); '' this is enough e.g. for the Arduino, defaults parameters are DATABITS_8,STOPBITS_1,PARITY_NONE
</source>

<source>
Ext.open("COM1",14400,"DATABITS_8 STOPBITS_2 PARITY_ODD"); '' advanced serial port configuration

'' Available options

'' DEFAULT: 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity
 
'' Databits:
'' DATABITS_5
'' DATABITS_6
'' DATABITS_7
'' DATABITS_8

'' Stopbits:
'' STOPBITS_1
'' STOPBITS_2
'' STOPBITS_1_5

'' Parity:
'' PARITY_NONE
'' PARITY_EVEN
'' PARITY_ODD
'' PARITY_MARK
'' PARITY_SPACE

</source>


* Read what the serial device sends:
<source>
data = Ext.read();
</source>
* Send a string command to the serial device:
<source>
Ext.write("a");
</source>

* Close the active serial port:
<source>
Ext.close();
</source>

* Poll if a serial connection is already there:
<source>
active = Ext.alive();
'' returns "0" or "1"
</source>

* 0.12 : GA and MS fixed a byte encoding issue.
