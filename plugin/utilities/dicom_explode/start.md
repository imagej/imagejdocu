# DICOM_explode

You have been given access to a single hodgepodge directory of DICOM
files and you would like to copy them into a hierarchical
Study/Series/Images structure.

## Author

Fred Damen

## Features

The plugin will first prompt for the directory that contains the source
DICOM files, and then, the plugin prompts for the parent directory to
contain the sorted hierarchical Study/Series/Images structure, and then,
the plugin copies/sorts the DICOM files.

## Install

Place the file
![DICOM_explode.java](/plugin/utilities/dicom_explode/dicom_explode.java){.align-center}
in your plugins directory, then compile&run; or just place the
![DICOM_explode.class](/plugin/utilities/dicom_explode/dicom_explode.class){.align-center}
file in your plugins directory and refresh the menus / restart ImageJ.
**Note that DICOM should be in uppercase in the file names.**
