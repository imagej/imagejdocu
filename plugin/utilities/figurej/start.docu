===== Disclaimer =====
&lt;code&gt;
The core of FigureJ for laying out images should work properly on all systems. 
Links to external tools were not tested on all Windows versions and require that 
you have those external programs installed and configured.
&lt;/code&gt;
===== Video tutorials =====
Start by creating the figure canvas


&lt;html&gt;
&lt;object width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/BrEDg-ZozE0?version=3&amp;amp;hl=fr_FR&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/BrEDg-ZozE0?version=3&amp;amp;hl=fr_FR&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


Then visually assign image content to each panel


&lt;html&gt;
&lt;object width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/Qqv36n-thq0?version=3&amp;amp;hl=fr_FR&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/Qqv36n-thq0?version=3&amp;amp;hl=fr_FR&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;


Add scalebars and decorations


&lt;html&gt;

1 beta 12 : release for the 2012 ImageJ Conference
===== Known Bugs =====

:!: FigureJ, or other plugins that could attempt to restore startup macros upon quitting, should not be started from the startup macros.

:!: FIJI-only: preference dialog not in the plugins menu.

FIXED - You're getting the error message: &quot;Plugin or class not found: &quot;FigureJ_Tool&quot; (java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ij/plugin/tool/PluginTool

=&gt; This error is probably due to the fact that you are using an ImageJ version
less than 1.46d. The missing PluginTool class was added with 1.46d11. You
should upgrade to the latest ImageJ version using Help &gt; Update ImageJ.

FIXED - You're getting the error message: &quot;java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError&quot;

=&gt; You should consider upgrading java to a more current version. Easiest method is to download  the current ImageJ for windows package that includes java.
