====== Seam Carving ======

Seam Carving (a.k.a content-aware image resizing) is an image manipulation technique for resizing images by removing image content that contributes little to image appearance. Thus more image features are preserved compared to cropping or scaling. The technique was suggested by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir in the paper //Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing//. You can find the paper and a demo video at http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/.
