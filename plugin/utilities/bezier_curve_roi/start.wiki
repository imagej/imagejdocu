An ImageJ plugin filter which implements a bezier curve roi. To use (once installed) simply click, drag and release on an image to define a starting point (Bezier control point zero) and the first Bezier control point. Then click , drag and release again to define the curves end point (Bezier control point three) and second Bezier control point. The shape of the curve can be altered by clicking on any of the control points and dragging them around until the desired shape is reached. New curve segments can be added to the curve by holding down the space bar and clicking on any of the control points which form part of the curve. Likewise, segments can be removed by holding on the Shift key a clicking on any of the same control point. A single clicking anywhere on the image outside the control points will stop the plugin.
