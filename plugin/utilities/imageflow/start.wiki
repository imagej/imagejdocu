'''This plugin allows to create macros in a visual node-based interface.'''

This plugin offers a node-based graphical user interface for Macro-creation and image editing. It allows to create macros by connecting nodes to form a workflow, which represents the way macro-commands are called by ImageJ. These workflows can be saved and loaded.

A workflow consists of Sources, which load or create images. They will be connected to other units to define the order of processing. A workflow requires at least one node to be defined as a display. The result of this unit will be opened after running the workflow.

ImageFlow is also available as a stand-alone program that uses ImageJ as a library. To run it, download and extract the archive Imageflow.zip and double click on the ImageFlow_.jar.
Works on all plattforms, Java 5.0 or later must be installed.

A number of unit-elements for building graphs are included, however the list is not very long yet. [[http://imageflow.danielsenff.de/imagej/Unit%20XML%20Documentation.html|Documentation]] on how to create own units is included and can be used. I can incorporate more units in later releases.
Feedback of any kind is well appreciated.
