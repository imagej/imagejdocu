====== Quadratic Curve ROI ======

**Uses a polyline ROI with at least two sides, a polygon ROI or a rectangle ROI to make a quadratic curve. Edit the ROI to change the curve and once the curve is as you want it click away from it (as you would to remove it) and a curve ROI will take its place.**
