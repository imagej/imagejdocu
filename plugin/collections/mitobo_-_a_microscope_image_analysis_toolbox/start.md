The Microscope Image Analysis Toolbox **MiToBo** is a collection of
various image analysis algorithms ranging from basic image processing
operations to sophisticated segmentation techniques.\
MiToBo for example includes:

\- **morphological operators**\
- **linear/non-linear filtering**\
- **image enhancement** techniques\
- **binarization methods**\
- **2D snakes** including different energies\
- PDE and nonPDE **levelsets** including different energies\
- undecimated **wavelet transformation**\
- **texture measures**\
- \...

In addition, MiToBo offers various specialized tools for the analysis of
biomedical image data:

\- **Scratch Assay Analyzer** for analyzing microscope image data from
cell migration experiments \[1,2\]\
- **Neuron Analyzer** for the segmentation of neurons in 2D microscope
images

\- **Actin Analyzer 2D** for quantifying structural differences in actin
or microtubuli organization

\- **MTB Cell Counter** for semi-automatic counting of sub-cellular
structures in plants like plastides, stromuli and stomata

\- **Particle Detector** for detecting sub-cellular particles in 2D
microscopy images based on wavelet transformations \[3\]

\- **2D Nucleus Detector** for segmenting nuclei in DAPI stained
microscope images

\- \...

For more details about these applications visit [MiToBo\'s Applications
and Projects
page](http://www2.informatik.uni-halle.de/agprbio/mitobo/index.php/Applications).

On the programming level MiToBo offers a programmer friendly framework
for easy implementation of new algorithms and ImageJ plugins,
respectively, including automatically generated graphical and command
line user interfaces for these algorithms. In addition, MiToBo provides
an automatic documentation of processing pipelines based on operators
and plugins implemented within the MiToBo framework, and also all
operators are available in the graphical programming editor Grappa
shipped with MiToBo. Most of this functionality is provided by the
[Alida](http://www.informatik.uni-halle.de/alida) library which forms
the fundament of MiToBo.

## Authors

The MiToBo toolbox is developed by Birgit Möller and Stefan Posch at the
Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany, by
the Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics Group at the Institute of
Computer Science, Faculty of Natural Sciences III, in cooperation with
Markus Glaß and Danny Misiak working at the Division for Molecular Cell
Biology, Institute of Molecular Medicine, of the Medical Faculty of the
Martin Luther University.
