===== Edge and Symmetry filter =====
3D Canny-Deriche edge detection filter and symmetry filter.

===== Author =====
Thomas Boudier 

===== Description =====
This plugin will compute the gradients of the image based on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector|Canny edge detector]]. 
The symmetry filter will vote for the voxels inside the object based on the gradient vector direction. 

**Alpha parameter** refers to the smoothing in canny edge detection, the smaller the value, the smoother the edges.

The **radius** parameter refer to the radius of the object whose symmetry is to be detected. Normalization and scaling refer to internal values of the algorithm, see Gertych //et al.// for references. The smoothed version is smoothed using ImageJ 3D Gaussian filter with a radius 2. 

The **improved seed detection** refer to a modified implementation to better detect seeds inside objects rather than objects themselves.

The gradient vector is perpendicular to the edges, voxels along the direction of the gradient are highlighted and //vote// for the symmetry.
