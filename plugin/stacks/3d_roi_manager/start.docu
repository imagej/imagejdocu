===== 3D Roi Manager  =====
This plugin adds a 3D Roi Manager to ImageJ and should be used as a complement to [[plugin:analysis:3d_object_counter:start|3D Objects Counter]].

Thomas Boudier
===== Features =====
A tutorial can be found [[tutorial:working:tutorial_for_3d_roi_manager|here]].

* 3D thresholding and segmentation

* 3D quantitative measurements (volume, surface, feret, ellipsoid fitting, ...)
 
* 3D intensity measurements (min, max, mean, integrated density, ...)

* 3D distance measurements (centre to centre, centre to border, border to border, radial distance, eccentricity)

* 3D co-localisation and contact surface

* 3D split (tries to split the object in two)

* 3D angle (between 3 objects)

* 3D list of voxels

* Can interact with 3D Viewer

* Macro recordable

===== Description =====
This plugin acts as a **RoiManager** for **3D objects**, the image can be segmented directly within the plugin via the //3D segment// button. 

Typically the objects would have been segmented with the [[plugin:analysis:3d_object_counter:start|3D Objects Counter]] plugin. Then use the// Add Image// button to import the objects into the 3D RoiManager. 

The measurements and options can be set in **3D Manager Options**. 

The functions works on selected objects, you can choose to select only one object with //MonoSelect// or multiple selection with //MultiSelect//. If no objects are selected, the functions will work on all objects.

The list of available macros functions are available {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:macrosfunctionsroimanager3d.pdf|here}}. Here are examples of macros : 

  * {{:plugin:stacks:3d_roi_manager:macromanager3d2_measure.ijm|Basic use of measurements, save and close window}}
  * {{:plugin:stacks:3d_roi_manager:macromanager3d_quantifmultichannel.ijm|Example for signal quantification}}
  * {{:plugin:stacks:3d_roi_manager:macromanager3d_quantifmultichannel2.ijm|Example 2 for signal quantification}}
  * {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:macromanager3d2_selected.ijm|Example to get the list of selected objects}}
  * {{:plugin:stacks:3d_roi_manager:macromanager3d2_centres.ijm|Draw a sphere at position of objects centre}}
  * {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:macromanager3d2_minmax.ijm|Find the smallest and biggest object}}
  * {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:macromanager3d2_colorsize.ijm|Colorize the objects based on their volume}}
  * {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:macromanager3d2_colorsviewer3d.ijm|Displays the objects in 3D viewer with random colors}}
