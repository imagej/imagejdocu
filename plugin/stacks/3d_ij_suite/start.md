## Features

This \"suite\" is composed of :

-   [3D Filters](/plugin/filter/3d_filters/start) (mean, median, max,
    min, tophat, max local, \...) and [edge and symmetry
    filter](/plugin/filter/3d_edge_and_symmetry_filter/start)
-   [3D Segmentation](/plugin/segmentation/3d_spots_segmentation/start)
    (iterative thresholding, spots segmentation, watershed, \...)
-   [3D Mathematical
    Morphology](/plugin/morphology/3d_mathematical_morphology_/start)
    tools (fill holes, binary closing, distance map, \...)
-   [3D RoiManager](/plugin/stacks/3d_roi_manager/start) (3D display and
    analysis of 3D objects)
-   [3D Analysis](/plugin/analysis/3d_analysis/start) (Geometrical
    measurements, Mesh measurements, Convex hull, \...)
-   [3D MereoTopology](/plugin/analysis/3d_mereotopology/start)
    (Relationship between objects)
-   [3D Tools](/plugin/stacks/3d_tools/start) (Drawing ellipsoids and
    lines, cropping, \...)

A 2D/3D [spatial
statistics](/plugin/analysis/spatial_statistics_2d_3d/start) plugin is
also available.

## Installation

From version 2.7, 3D ImageJ Suite is available in Fiji as an [Fiji
update site](http://fiji.sc/List_of_update_sites). The **Java8** and
**ImageScience** update sites must be activated in Fiji, see
instructions [here](https://imagej.net/Following_an_update_site).

You can also install 3D ImageJ Suite
[manually](/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/start#download) and unzip it in
your plugins folder. The various plugins will appear in the menu *3D* of
the plugins list. You have also to manually download and copy into your
plugins directory the **imagescience.jar** library from
[here](http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/featurej/).

## Download

ImageJ 1.47 or later is required. Java3D is also required, check that
[3D Viewer](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/3d-viewer/) is working.

**NEW** From version 3.83 and later the new version 4.0.1 of 3D_Viewer
is required (please remove the 3D_Viewer plugin provided by ImageJ and
replace it by ![this
version](/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/3d_viewer-mcib.zip), just unzip the
file in the plugins directory).

Java 1.8 or later is required. \*\*The
[imagescience](http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/featurej/)
library is required \*\* :
[download](http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/download/imagescience.jar).
**Bundle** : ![](/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/mcib3d-suite3.96.zip)

Core library : ![](/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/mcib3d-core-3.96.jar)

Plugins : ![](/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/mcib3d_plugins-3.96.jar)

The
[ConvexHull3D](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/3d-convex-hull/index.html)
plugin is required only for mesh measurements : ![quickhull
jar](/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/quickhull3d-1.0.0.jar)

Sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for
[core](https://github.com/mcib3d/mcib3d-core) and
[plugins](https://github.com/mcib3d/mcib3d-plugins).
