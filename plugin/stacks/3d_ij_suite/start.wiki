With many contributions from J. Ollion, Laboratoire Jean Perrin, Paris, France.
== Features ==

This "suite" is composed of : 

* [[plugin:filter:3d_filters:start|3D Filters]] (mean, median, max, min, tophat, max local, ...) and [[plugin:filter:3d_edge_and_symmetry_filter:start|edge and symmetry filter]]
* [[plugin:segmentation:3d_spots_segmentation:start|3D Segmentation]] (iterative thresholding, spots segmentation, watershed, ...)
* [[plugin:morphology:3d_mathematical_morphology_:start|3D Mathematical Morphology]] tools (fill holes, binary closing, distance map, ...)
* [[plugin:stacks:3d_roi_manager:start|3D RoiManager]] (3D display and analysis of 3D objects)
* [[plugin:analysis:3d_analysis:start|3D Analysis]] (Geometrical measurements, Mesh measurements, Convex hull, ...)
* [[plugin:analysis:3d_mereotopology:start|3D MereoTopology]] (Relationship between objects)
* [[plugin:stacks:3d_tools:start|3D Tools]] (Drawing ellipsoids and lines, cropping, ...)

A 2D/3D [[plugin:analysis:spatial_statistics_2d_3d:start|spatial statistics]] plugin is also available.

== Installation ==
From version 2.7, 3D ImageJ Suite is available in Fiji as an [[http://fiji.sc/List_of_update_sites|Fiji update site]]. The '''Java8''' and '''ImageScience''' update sites must be activated in Fiji, see instructions [[https://imagej.net/Following_an_update_site|here]]. 

You can also install 3D ImageJ Suite [[plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:start#download|manually]] and unzip it in your plugins folder. The various plugins will appear in the menu ''3D'' of the plugins list.
You have also to manually download and copy into your plugins directory the '''imagescience.jar''' library from [[http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/featurej/|here]].


== Download ==
ImageJ 1.47 or later is required. Java3D is also required, check that [[http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/3d-viewer/|3D Viewer]] is working. 

'''NEW''' From version 3.83 and later the new version 4.0.1 of 3D_Viewer is required (please remove the 3D_Viewer plugin provided by ImageJ and replace it by {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:3d_viewer-mcib.zip|this version}}, just unzip the file in the plugins directory). 

Java 1.8 or later is required. '''The [[http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/featurej/|imagescience]] library is required ''' : [[http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/download/imagescience.jar|download]]. 
'''Bundle''' : {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:mcib3d-suite3.94.zip|}}

Core library : {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:mcib3d-core3.94.jar|}}

Plugins : {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:mcib3d_plugins3.94.jar|}}

The [[http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/3d-convex-hull/index.html| ConvexHull3D]] plugin is required only for mesh measurements : {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:quickhull3d-1.0.0.jar|quickhull jar}}
