===== Features =====

It is frequently observed that fluorescence intensity decreases with depth
in confocal microscopy image stacks.
This plugin applies an attenuation correction to rectify the fluorescence levels throughout
the stack.
The implemented algorithm relies on the assumption that the background is
stationnary in the absence of attenuation.
The correction thus consists in applying a linear transformation of grey levels to each
slice image, in order to make the average and standard-deviation of the background
constant (equal to that of a reference slice) throughout the image stack.

The background is estimated by applying a grey level morphological opening to each slice.
It is thus assumed that the fluorescent objects are small compared to image size.
The radius of the opening should be chosen according to the object size (diameter, thickness).

Further details on the method can be found in Biot et al. (2008).

===== Example =====

The first image displays a montage of an image stack with a strong attenuation
of fluorescence intensity.
The second image displays the same stack after correction with this plugin (the first
slice was selected as reference).

===== Usage =====

The plugin accepts 8, 16 and 32 bits grey level image stacks.

The plugin lets the user select the following two parameters:

  * **Opening radius**: radius of the morphological opening used to estimate background images.\\ //Hint//: The radius should be as large as the radius (or thickness) of the smallest objects.
  * **Reference slice**: index of the slice selected as reference (this slice will not be modified).\\ //Hint//: The reference slice will generally be the first (upper-most) slice containing objects.

//Preprocessing//: to prevent noise (when present) from being enhanced by the correction, 
it is recommended to apply a noise reduction filter before running the plugin.

===== Installation =====

Download the {{:plugin:stacks:attenuation_correction:attenuation_correction.class.zip|}} file and extract the ''Attenuation_Correction.class'' file it contains into your ImageJ plugin directory.\\
The plugin will appear as ''Attenuation Correction'' in the Plugins menu.
