'''Thresholding by two thresholds for edge detection.'''

This plugin performs a hysteresis thresholding for edge detection using two thresholds. Low thresholded edges which are connected to high thresholded edges are retained. Low thresholded edges which are non connected to high thresholded edges are removed.

This leads to the creation of 3 classes : below low threshold (to be removed), above high threshold (to be retained), and between low and high thresholds (to be retained only if connected to a edge above high threshold). 

Download {{:plugin:segmentation:hysteresis_thresholding:hysteresis_.class|}} to your plugins directory and then restart ImageJ or use the Update Menus command.
