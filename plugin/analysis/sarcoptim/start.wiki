= SarcOptiM (High Frequency Online Sarcomere Length Measurement) =

== Introduction ==
SarcOptiM computes the spatial frequency of the striated pattern of a myocyte. It has been successfully tested on rat ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes. Although not tested, it is expected to work on skeletal muscle fibers.<br />The analysis can be performed online on video capture inside ImageJ (e.g.: using the webcam plugin or HF_IDS_Cam plugin) or offline on a previously recorded video.
<br />In the online mode, the HF_IDS_Cam plugin with an IDS UI-1220LE camera allows high frequency online recording of sarcomere shortening (up to 1000 Hz) limited only by the frame rate of the camera.
<br />A complete description can be found in the above publication.
