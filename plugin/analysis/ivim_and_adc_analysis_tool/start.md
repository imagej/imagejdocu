# Intravoxel Incoherent Motion IVIM and ADC

Intravoxel Incoherent Motion IVIM and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient ADC

## Introduction

1.  This plugin for ImageJ can perform IVIM analysis, according to the
    theory of Dr. Denis Lebihan.
2.  This plugin also can generate ADC maps from DWI images

## Features

For IVIM calculation only 3 slices are needed the plugin will generate
IVIM image, Difussion D and Perfusion f. For ADC more than two slices
are needed.

## Description

The plugin is based in the IVIM method. Can generate IVIM, Difussion,
and Perfusion maps from tree slices with different b values. The first b
value should be 0, the second should be lower than the third one. The
result should be analyzed carefully. The max value for calculated ADC
can be modified. For ADC analysis, just is necesary open the stack with
a DWI sequence, with different b values. THE USE of this software is
under the final user responsability. Until 2009-12-29 was tested with
some basic data. The plugin needs to be tested more DWI data.

## Installation

Download the zip file and paste in the plugins directory. Then restart
ImageJ

## Download

I am doing the relevant documentation. Until January or February of 2010
the zip file will be available.
