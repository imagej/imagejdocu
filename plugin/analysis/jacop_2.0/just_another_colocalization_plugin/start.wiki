== Features ==
JACoP allows:\\
'''''Calculating a set of commonly used co-localization indicators:'''''
* Pearson's coefficient
* Overlap coefficient
* k1 &amp; k2 coefficients
* Manders' coefficient
'''''Generating commonly used visualizations:'''''
* Cytofluorogram
'''''Having access to more recently published methods:'''''
* Costes' automatic threshold
* Li's ICA
* Costes' randomization
* Objects based methods (2 methods: distances between centres and centre-particle coincidence)
\\
NB: All methods are implemented to work on 3D datasets.
== Description ==
JACoP has been totaly re-written, based on user feedback. The interface has been re-designed to oﬀer full access to all the options, based on a unique Swing frame.\\
{{:plugin:analysis:jacop_2.0:just_another_colocalization_plugin:jacop_interface.jpg|JACoP v2.0: The new interface}}<br />
It includes a “Zoom/Reset button” which allows the user to set the two selected images side-by-side, automatically adapting the zoom. For each method selected, the user’s attention is drawn on options to set, by highlighting the appropriate tab by turning 
its caption to red.
