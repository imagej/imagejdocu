==== History ====

  * 2004/02/02: First version
  * 2005/01/28: Version 1.1: statistical methods added.
  * 2006/08/29: Version 1.2
    * ratio bars non destructively displayed
    * works with any closed ROI
    * Fire LUT better diplayed 
    * You now have to click in the ROI to update overaly image(s) and statistics
  * 2016/03/21: Version 1.3
    * replacement of the deprecated functions (getBoundingRect, IJ.write) by the new ones
    * extension of the plugin for whatever picture dynamics
    * addition of a plot (with legends, ticks (minor and major), labels) within the scatter plot
    * the selected points within the overlay picture are updated as soon as the ROI in the scatter plot is modified or dragged over
    * possibility to move the ROI position (within the scatter plot) from the mouse position within the overlay picture
    * possibility to set ROIs with given colors with a mouse double click
    * possibility to generate the x or y histogram with a Gaussian fit in order to extract the histogram maximum position by using the numeric pad 4/6 or 2/8 keys
  * 2019/10/14: Version 1.4:
    * addition of scripting possibilities illustrated within the macro example that can be downloaded here: [[http://punias.free.fr/ImageJ/download/Colocalization_Finder_Macro1.ijm|macro1]] and [[http://punias.free.fr/ImageJ/download/Colocalization_Finder_Macro2.ijm|macro2]] .
    * colocalization calculations are performed using double parameters instead of float
   * 2021/01/28: Version 1.6:
    * possibility to choose the size of the scatter plot upon start of the plugin
    * addition of a label panel at the bottom of the scatterPlot picture displaying the limits of the scatterPlot Roi selection
    * addition of a &quot;Set&quot; button at the bottom left of the scatterPlot picture allowing so set the limits of the scatterPlot graph and/or of the scatterPlot Roi (the 'g' key gives the same features)
    * the possibility to set ROIs with given colors with a mouse double click has been erased (due to the ImageJ 1.53c 26 June 2020 update) and replaced by a Ctrl + mouse click user action 
=== Installation ===

  * Source: Contained in the JAR file. 
  * Installation: Download [[http://punias.free.fr/ImageJ/download/Colocalization_Finder.jar|Colocalization_Finder.jar]] to the plugins folder, or subfolder, restart ImageJ, and there will the &quot;Colocalization Finder...&quot; new command in the Plugins menu.

=== Description ===
	
This plugin displays a correlation diagram for two images (8bits, same size). Drawing a rectangular selection on this diagram allows you to highlight corresponding pixels on a RGB overlap of the original images, and if selected, on a 3rd image. Analysis can be restricted to pixels having values with a minimum ratio. Selection settings are logged to a results window. 

Parts of this code were taken from plugins by W. Rasband, P. Bourdoncle, and G. Chinga.

The results table with computer Pearson's correlation, Overlap coefficient, contribution of both channels to OC, Slope and intercept of the linear regression,% pixels selected, min and max in both channels.
