===== Distance Analysis (DiAna) =====

This plugin allows :
  * Calculating co-localization between objects in 3D
  * Measuring 3D distances between nearest object, co-localized or not
  * Getting some 3D measurements about each objects

The plugin can be used with labelled images, but it also integrates tools for the segmentation of the objects.

===== Features =====

__Denoise filter__
  * Mean, Median, Gaussian blur filters

__Segmentation of the objects__
  * Global thresholding
  * [[plugin:segmentation:3d_spots_segmentation:start|3D spot segmentation]]
  * [[plugin:segmentation:3d_spots_segmentation:start|3D iterative segmentation]]

__Object based co-localization and distance analysis__
  * Colocalization from objects in image A, B, and/or A+B
  * Distance center – center ;
  * Distance center – edge ;
  * Distance edge – center ;
  * Surface in contact
  * Generates results representations such as:
  *       - Objects' map;
  *       - Colocalization object's map ;

__Counting and measurements on objects__

Counts the number of 3D objects in two stacks.

Quantifies for each found object the following parameters:
  * Volume
  * Mean of the gray values
  * Surface area
  * Standard deviation of the gray values
  * Minimum &amp; Maximum gray values
  * Centroid
  * Centre of mass
  * Feret's Diameter


===== Description =====
//
Note that when the mouse arrow passes on the items of the plugin, an explanation of each parameter is given//.

Open at least two images. This plugin does not support RGB and 32-bits images.

==== Images to analyse ====
Select the image A and the image B. The image A is the reference image.

__Binary images:__

Apply threshold with value 1

Filter objects by size and remove objects from image edges is possible

__Gray level images:__

Apply filter to suppress noise (optional)

Segment the image with either threshold or spot segmentation method

- Threshold method :

choose a threshold value

Filter objects by size and remove objects from image edges is possible

- Spot segmentation method : a tutorial for this method is found [[plugin:segmentation:3d_spots_segmentation:start|here]] 

- Iterative segmentation method : a tutorial for this method is found [[plugin:segmentation:3d_spots_segmentation:start|here]]

- Filter objects by size is possible


==== Interactions filters ====

When unchecking « All objects touching » , the plugin will analyse the non co-localizing objects in addition to co-localizing objects.


==== Measures &amp; Analysis ====

__Colocalisation__

Choose the parameters that will be measured for co-localizing objects

__Distance__

Choose the parameters that will be measured for non co-localizing objects

__Shuffle__

Select to do a shuffle of the objects on all the image or inside a mask

__Other measures__

Choose the parameters that will be measured for each objects

__Resolution infos__
Image calibration has to be given for the measurements to be calibrated (otherwise they will given in pixels). If images opened are already calibrated, the plugin reads the calibration.


====The plugin retrieves :====

  * Objects from image A and B are listed in a ROI Manager.
  * Number of objects and number of co-localizing objects are given in the log window.
  * ColocResults gives measurements on co-localizing objects.
  * DistanceResults gives measurements on non co-localizing objects.
  * Curve of the shuffle (cumulative distances)
  * OtherMeasuresResults-A/B gives measurements on each objects from images A and B.

====Batch :====
if the recorder has a problem, here are some examples of macro line:
  * run(&quot;DiAna_Segment&quot;, &quot;img=imageName.tif filter=median rad=1.0 thr=739-3-2000-true-false&quot;);
  * run(&quot;DiAna_Segment&quot;, &quot;img=C0.tif peaks=2.0-2.0-50.0 spots=30-10-1.5-3-2000-true&quot;);
  * run(&quot;DiAna_Segment&quot;, &quot;img=C0.tif iter=3-2000-20-30-true&quot;);
  * run(&quot;DiAna_Analyse&quot;, &quot;img1=imageA.tif img2=imageB.tif lab1=segA.tif lab2=segB.tif coloc distc=50.0 adja kclosest=1 dista=50.0 measure&quot;);
===== Installation =====

Download and copy the following jar in your plugins folder {{:plugin:analysis:distance_analysis_diana_2d_3d:diana_1.44.jar|diAna_1.44.jar}}

You have also to manually download and copy into your plugins directory the [[plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:start|3D ImageJ Suite]].

Note that this version works only with {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:mcib3d-core3.94.jar|}} and upper!

If a problem appends, use version Core library : {{:plugin:stacks:3d_ij_suite:mcib3d-core3.94.jar|}} of mcib-core from the 3D Suite.
