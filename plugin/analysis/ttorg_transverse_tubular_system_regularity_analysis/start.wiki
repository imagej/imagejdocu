= TTorg (Transverse tubular system regularity analysis) =

== Introduction ==
The TTorg plugin uses microscopy images (usually opened with the Bio-formats plugin) to analyze the organization level and the regularity of the transverse tubular system in muscle cells. 
<br />This is an automated analysis, the TTorg interface uses a minimum set of options to reduce human intervention.
<br />A complete description can be found in the above publication.
