This plugin will compute the density of objects in a image based on distance analysis.

The '''NbNeighbors''' parameter will determine the number of closest neighbours to compute from each pixel. The distances are sum weighted using this formula :

''∑ (exp(-dist2i * C)'', with ''dist2i'' the squared distance to the ith closest point, and ''C = 1/(2*σ*σ''). 

The parameter '''radius''' is assimilated as σ and determines roughly the radius of ''expansion'' from the spot centre.

Density computation for the spots in top left, with increasing radius 5, 10 and 15.
