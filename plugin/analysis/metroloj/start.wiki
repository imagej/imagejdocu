This plugin has been created as part of the metrology workgroup work, within the framework of the [[http://rtmfm.cnrs.fr/|"French technological network for multidimensional fluorescence microscopies" (RT- MFM)]], supported by the [[http://www.mrct.cnrs.fr/|Mission ressources et compétences technologiques du CNRS" (MRCT)]]".
== Features ==
This plugin allows measuring relevant parameters which helps testing, following and comparing microscopes performances. This is achieved by extracting four indicators out of standardized images, acquired from standardized samples: the estimation of the detector sensitivity , the evaluation of the field illumination homogeneity, the system resolution, and finally the characterization of its spectral registration. 

== Description ==
This plugin is composed of five parts:
* Generate CV report
* Generate field illumination report
* Generate PSF report
* Generate axial resolution report
* Generate co-alignement report

Please refer to the {{:plugin:analysis:metroloj:metroloj.pdf|plugin's manual}} for more details.

== Installation ==
Simply download {{:plugin:analysis:metroloj:metroloj_.jar|}} to the Plugins folder of ImageJ, use the "Help/Update Menus" function to refresh the plugins' menu.

'''Reports are generated as pdf files, using currently the {{:plugin:analysis:metroloj:itext-2.1.4.jar|iText library v2.1.4}} ([[http://itextpdf.com/download.php|Newer versions are available from iText website, but are not yet compatible with MetroloJ]]) which should be downloaded to the Plugins folder of ImageJ.'''
