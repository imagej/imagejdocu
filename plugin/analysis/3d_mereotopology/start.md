## 3D MereoTopology

Computes RCC8D relationship between 3D Objects.

## Author

Thomas Boudier with the collaboration of G. Landini and D. Randell.

## Description

Objects can have many relationship between them (inclusion, overlapping,
\...). All the possible relationship are formalized in the MereoTopology
approach (see [Landini\'s
page](https://blog.bham.ac.uk/intellimic/spatial-reasoning-with-imagej-using-the-region-connection-calculus/)
for details).

You need two images with labelled objects.

## Download

For details go to the [3D ImageJ
Suite](/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/start).
