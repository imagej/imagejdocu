== 3D MereoTopology  ==
Computes RCC8D relationship between 3D Objects.

== Author ==
Thomas Boudier with the collaboration of G. Landini and D. Randell.

== Description ==
Objects can have many relationship between them (inclusion, overlapping, ...). All the possible relationship are formalized in the MereoTopology approach (see [[http://www.mecourse.com/landinig/software/spatial/rcc8d.html|Landini's page]] for details). 

You need two images with labelled objects.
