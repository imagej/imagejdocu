# Channel Merger

## Introduction

Channel Merger plugin allows merging multiple channels in one RGB stack.
The number of the channels that can be merged is not restricted by the
plugin. It provides manipulation of the color and visibility of the
channel. The resulting image is of the ImagePlus class that makes the
image compatible with ImageJ functionality (i.e. saving as tif stack,
adjusting brightness/contrast, viewing in 3DViewer, etc).
