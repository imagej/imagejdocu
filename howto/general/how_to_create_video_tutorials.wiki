== Wink ==

Wink is a tutorial creation software. You can capture screenshots, add notes, breakpoints and sound to the tutorials. In this way you can do high quality tutorials about software. These interactive tutorials are exported then into the Shockwave Flash (SWF) format, which makes it easy to embed them into a web browser page.
