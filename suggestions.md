# Suggestions and bugs with the use of this wiki

## Open

-   **Download links are transformed into lower case letters**. This
    does not work for Java Source files, as file names need to be
    unchanged \[reported by Gabriel Landini\]
-   **Plugins section:** It would be cool if a small description of the
    plugin can be seen at at the overview page. \[reported by Michael
    Schmidt\]
-   **Improved Search of the wiki**. We might search the maillist as
    well. \[reported by Jerome Mutterer\]

## Closed

-   **File download of java files does not work**: \"fetch.php\" is
    downloaded and type of this file is \"PHP\".
