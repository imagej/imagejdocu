====== Freehand crop and exclusion. ======


If you select a freehand area, it would be nice if “edge” were redefined as the edge of the selection rather than remaining as the rectangular edge of the original image.
 We could then analyse non rectangular image selections and have an “exclude on edges” to avoid having to painstakingly trace exactly around all items of interest, and then do a “clear outside”. [reported by James Connolly]
