It would be nice to have built in keyboard short cuts for hyperstacks.
So as well as the current \< \> next/previous slice, next previous
channel and frame would be useful

\-\--

This functionality was added in version 1.42l:

    Added keyboard shortcuts for hyperstacks: 
    &gt; - next channel 
    &lt; - previous channel 
    ctrl+&gt; - next slice 
    ctrl+&lt; - previous slice 
    alt+&gt; - next frame 
    alt+&lt; - previous frame
