'''Some procedure to update the ij.jar file when there is a new version.'''

Auto updater plugin/command: ideally, this command would allow to check the latest version in the IJ site. If a new version exists, it would download the new version (and optionally the functions.html file, source, etc). Unfortunately it is currently necessary to restart IJ. Perhaps somebody has an idea of how this can be avoided.

Done!
