======  16 bit color ======

**Native support for opening 16 bit color tiffs needed**

A lot of scientific data is acquired at 16 bit resolution in color. This has to be reduced to inferior 8 bit resolution in ImageJ to view the color and  manipulate the images or make measurements.   

&lt;code&gt;

Done!

Since version 1.38n, ImageJ can open 48bit tiff images as a stack.

&lt;/code&gt;
