It would be nice to have built in keyboard short cuts for hyperstacks. So as well as the current < > next/previous slice, next previous channel and frame would be useful

This functionality was added in version 1.42l:

Added keyboard shortcuts for hyperstacks: <br />
  > - next channel 
  < - previous channel 
  ctrl+> - next slice 
  ctrl+< - previous slice 
  alt+> - next frame
