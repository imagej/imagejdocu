====== FAQ: Is there a book or manual to ImageJ? ======

Note that ImageJ is constantly evolving so there is no single book on ImageJ that covers **all** functions, macros and plugins available. That being said, the ImageJ User Guide is available on the [[http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/|ImageJ website]]. The following are some of other resources available:

  * [[http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/index.html|ImageJ Documentation]] at the ImageJ website.
  * [[http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/macros.html|ImageJ Macro Language]] at the ImageJ website.
  * Reference to the [[http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/functions.html|Macro Functions]] at the ImageJ website.
