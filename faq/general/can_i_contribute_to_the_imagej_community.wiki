= FAQ: Can I contribute to the ImageJ community? =

Yes, of course you can. If you write some interesting macros or plugins let the community know. You can upload them here (requires registration) or you can post a message in the ImageJ mailing list.

If you found some improvement to ImageJ, you could also contact the author of ImageJ to suggest inclusion in a future version.
