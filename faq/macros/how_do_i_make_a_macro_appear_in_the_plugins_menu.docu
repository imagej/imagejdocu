====== FAQ: How do I make a macro appear in the Plugins Menu? ======

**Apart from installing a macro, how can I make a macro file to appear listed in the Plugins menu?** 

Include an underscore &quot;_&quot; in the macro name and save it in the Plugins folder (or one folder below). After re-starting ImageJ, the macro name will appear in the Plugins menu, with the underscore character converted into a space.

For example, **MyMacro.txt** will not appear in the menu, but** My_Macro.txt** and **Macro_.txt** will be listed as &quot;**My Macro**&quot; and &quot;**Macro**&quot; respectively.
