= FAQ: How do I make a macro appear in the Plugins Menu? =

'''Apart from installing a macro, how can I make a macro file to appear listed in the Plugins menu?''' 

Include an underscore "_" in the macro name and save it in the Plugins folder (or one folder below). After re-starting ImageJ, the macro name will appear in the Plugins menu, with the underscore character converted into a space.

For example, '''MyMacro.txt''' will not appear in the menu, but''' My_Macro.txt''' and '''Macro_.txt''' will be listed as "'''My Macro'''" and "'''Macro'''" respectively.
