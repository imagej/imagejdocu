# FAQ: How do I quantify a gel with ImageJ ?

Electrophoretic gels such as Western blots can be quantified easily with
ImageJ using the Analyze▷Gels▷ commands, as described on this [video
tutorial](/video/analysis/gel_quantification_analysis). Further details
are explained on the [ImageJ User
Guide](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-30.html#toc-Subsection-30.13).
Please read the Guide\'s section [Using Scanners in
Densitometry](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-30.html#infobox:Densitometry)
before performing your quantifications.
