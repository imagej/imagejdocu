# FAQ: My image stack is too large!

**The image stack I am trying to load is too large for the memory I can
allocate. Is there any way I can load it?**

You might be able to work around the memory limit by using the Virtual
Stack Opener plugin at:
<http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/virtual-opener.html> This plugin
allows viewing and analyzing image sequences that do not fit in memory.
