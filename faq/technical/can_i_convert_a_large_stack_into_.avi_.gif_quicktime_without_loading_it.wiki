= FAQ: Can I convert a large stack into .avi, .gif, QuickTime without loading it? =

'''Some stacks are too large to fit in RAM to be loaded and saved in an animation format. How do I overcome this?'''

Wayne provided this answer in the mailing list:\\

With ImageJ 1.39k and later, you can frame-by-frame convert a large TIFF by opening stack it using '''File>Import>TIFF Virtual Stack '''and saving it using '''File>Save As>AVI''', '''File>Save As>Gif (animated GIF)''' or '''File>Save As>QuickTime Movie'''. Set the frame rate in the '''Image>Stacks>Animation Options''' dialog.
