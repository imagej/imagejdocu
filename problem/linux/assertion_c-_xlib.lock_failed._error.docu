====== &quot;Assertion `c-&gt;xlib.lock' failed.&quot; error ======

**In openSUSE 10.3, ImageJ with Java 1.6 can give an &quot;Assertion `c-&gt;xlib.lock' failed.&quot; error that prevents it running.**

Open the file **/etc/profile** in your favourite text editor as the root user.

Then, add the the following statement just before the end of the file:

  #  
  # Enable lock assertion workaround
  # 
  export LIBXCB_ALLOW_SLOPPY_LOCK=true
