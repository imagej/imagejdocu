# Alt-key shortcuts do not work

**Problem:** The Alt keyboard shortcut to manipulate ROIs does not work.
This is because the GUI uses the same shortcut for an alternative
function (for example move a window around the desktop.

**Solution:** In KDE you can change the behaviour of the Modifier Key
(to alternatively listen to the Meta key). Setting ***System
Settings\>Window Behaviour\>Modifier key*** to \"Meta\" (default is
\"Alt\") resolves this problem. Note that now the Meta-key (also called
Win-key in some keyboards) executes the command of KDE.

If there is a similar setting in Gnome, please add it here.
